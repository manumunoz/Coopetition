            Task 2 is an encryption task identical to task 1. The main difference is the way Bonus 2 is calculated. There
            are <b>two elements</b> to calculate Bonus 2:
            <ul>
                <li>A payment scheme you will choose between two options (this is explained below), and</li>
                <br>
                <li>Your score and the score of another participant in the encryption task 2. For the example, we
                use the illustration in Figure 1 where YOU score 10 correct words and the OTHER participant scores 12.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>YOU</b> and the <b>OTHER</b> participant will be randomly matched if both of you choose the <b>same</b> payment
            scheme. Both YOU and the OTHER participant went through both the trial and the encryption Task 1 before Task 2.
            </p>

            <h5>Payment Scheme 1</h5>
            <p>
                If you choose scheme 1, Bonus 2 is calculated using the scores YOU and the OTHER participant get.
                Specifically, the payment will be determined by the individual score and half of the sum of both players scores.
                <br><br>
                <b>Example:</b> YOU scored <b>10</b> and the OTHER scored <b>12</b> correct words. Half of the sum of
                both playersâ€™ scores is (10+12) / 2 = 11. Then
                <ul>
                    <li>YOU receive (10 + 11) = 21 points. </li>
                    <li>The OTHER player receives (12 + 11) = 23 points.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 border rounded" id="light_bg">
            <h5>Payment Scheme 2</h5>
            <p>
                If you choose scheme 2, Bonus 2 is calculated differently for the participant with highest score than for
                the participant with lowest score. The participants with lowest score will be paid a bonus equal to his
                score. The participant with the highest score will be paid a bonus equal to three times his score.
                <br><br>
                <b>Example:</b> YOU scored <b>10</b> and the OTHER scored <b>12</b> correct words. The OTHER participant
                has the highest score. Then:
                <ul>
                    <li>YOU receive 10 points. </li>
                    <li>The OTHER player receives (12 * 3) = 36 points.</li>
                </ul>
                In case of a tie, the computer will randomly choose between YOU and the OTHER to be paid the higher bonus.
                This means that, the chosen participant will be paid 3 times his score and the participant not chosen
                will be paid his score.

               At the end of the experiment, you will receive information about the number of words that you and the other
                participants encrypted correctly.
